**Character count** - Write a function that takes a string and outputs the most and least common characters along with their total counts. In the event of a tie, return the character with the lowest code point. For example:

    ```ruby
    f('supercalifragilisticexpialidocious')
    # 7 'i', 1 'd'
    f('technicolor dreamcoat')
    # 3 'c', 1 ' '
    ```

**Reverse a String** - Enter a string and the program will reverse it and print it out.
