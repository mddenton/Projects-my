**Character count** - Write a function that takes a string and outputs the most and least common characters along with their total counts. In the event of a tie, return the character with the lowest code point. For example:

    ```ruby
    f('supercalifragilisticexpialidocious')
    # 7 'i', 1 'd'
    f('technicolor dreamcoat')
    # 3 'c', 1 ' '
    ```

**Reverse a String** - Enter a string and the program will reverse it and print it out.

**Word Extractor** - Extract text from document to output list of unique words contained therein.

**Caesar Cipher** - Input a string along with the user's desired number of letter shifts. Replace each plaintext letter with a letter a fixed number of places down the alphabet. For example with a shift of three, an E in the plaintext becomes H in the ciphertext.
